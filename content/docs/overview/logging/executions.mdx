When you're working with workflows in Lecca.io, understanding and managing Executions are essential to ensure efficiency and troubleshoot any issues that arise. Here’s everything you need to know about Executions.

## Overview

Executions occur each time a workflow runs in Lecca.io. You can monitor these Executions on the Executions page.

Each Execution represents a specific instance of a workflow execution. When a workflow is triggered, an Execution is created and logged on the Executions page.

## Managing Executions

On the Executions page, you will have access to important information, such as:

- **Start and End Times:** Monitor the duration of each workflow execution.
- **Status:** Track the current state of the execution, whether it’s running, completed, or encountered an error.
- **Referenced Workflow:** Quickly identify which workflow is being executed.

Executions are initiated when a trigger step within the workflow is activated.

### Viewing Execution Details

To get a detailed view of each execution:

1.  Navigate to the **Executions Page**.
2.  Observe the list of executions with their respective start and end times, status, and referenced workflows.
3.  If an execution is still running, it will be marked accordingly, allowing you to track its progress in real-time.
4.  Should there be any errors within an execution, error outputs will be displayed for effective debugging.
