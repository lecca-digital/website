title: Workflows
---

Lecca.io's Workflows allow you to automate a series of actions. Workflows can split paths, conditionally execute steps, schedule tasks, wait for human intervention, and much more.

## Triggers

<Callout>All workflows must have a trigger</Callout>

A trigger can be one of the following:

1. Manually Run

   - Allows a user to manually run the workflow by clicking the play button next to the trigger.
   - Allows an AI Agent to run the workflow and use it as a tool. If you add an `Ouput Workflow Data` action to the workflow, the agent will also wait for the response. The agent must have the `Run Workflow` tool enabled.
   - Allows another workflow to run the workflow. And just like the Agent, if you add the `Ouput Workflow Data` action, the workflow will wait for the response.

     <Callout type="warn">
       The an agent or workflow are waiting for a response, the response will
       time out after 60 seconds.
     </Callout>

2. Recurring Schedule

   - Build a CRON schedule for your workflow to follow. This schedule can trigger workflow executions on intervals a low as 1 minute.

3. Listen for webhook

   - Make an HTTP request to your webhook endpoint to trigger the workflow.

4. App Trigger

   - Configure a trigger from one of the available apps.

   <Callout>
     There are app polling triggers and app webhook triggers. Polling triggers
     check for new events every 15 minutes to an hour (depending on the plan
     you're on). And Webhook triggers are instant.
   </Callout>

## Actions

Actions are either integrations with third party apps or are provided directly by Lecca.io to execute some sort of function.

<Callout>Actions are the same tools you can give to an AI agent.</Callout>

Some examples of actions using integrations with third party apps are the following:

1. Sending & Drafting Emails
2. Managing Calendars events
3. Messaging and Replying with Slack

Some example of actions provided by Lecca.io are the following:

1. AI Actions
2. Human in the loop (Flow Control)
3. Saving and Searching Knowledge
4. Search the web
5. Date Helpers
6. CSV Helpers
7. JSON Helpers
8. Text Helpers

## Enable Workflow

Your workflows will not run unless you have enabled them.
