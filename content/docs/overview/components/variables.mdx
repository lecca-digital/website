title: Variables
---

You can create a variable in Lecca.io to use within trigger & action configurations. This is useful for referencing common values like names, emails, phrases, dates, numbers, keys, and more as a variable.

## Types of Variables

1. Text
2. Number
3. True/False
4. Date

## Using Variables

When configuring an action or trigger, you can use a variable in any text field by clicking the plus button on the end of the text field.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "56.25%",
    height: 0,
    overflow: "hidden",
    marginTop: "20px",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}

    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Sharing Variables

If you want to create variables that anyone in your workspace can use for their agents and workflows, do not assign the variables to a project when creating it.

However, if you want to restrict access to your variable, assign it to a project upon creation. Then only users with access to that project can use the variable.

<Callout type="warn">
  The assigned project cannot be removed, added, or modified after variable
  creation
</Callout>
