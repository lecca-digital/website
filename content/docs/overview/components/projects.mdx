Lecca.io's Projects feature serves as an organizational tool designed to organize and manage access to your components efficiently.

## Project Components

These components can be created within a project. If created within a project, only users with access to that project may view them or use them.

<Callout type="warn">
  Once a component is created, the assigned project can not be changed, added,
  or removed.
</Callout>

  can be created without a project, giving the whole workspace access to them.
