title: User Roles
---

There are 2 types of roles, **Maintainers** and **Members**.

### Maintainer

1. Can invite and remove team members to/from the workspace. This is not the same as inviting to a project. All members of a project can invite users to a project.
2. Can update the workspace subscription plan and update payment methods.
3. Can view all projects, executions, connections, variables, .etc.

  Maintainers can view and perform actions on anything within their workspace.
  Including projects they're not explicitly invited to.
</Callout>

### Member

1. Cannot invite new members to the workspace.
2. Can only access projects they've been invited to.
3. Cannot view workspace overview or workspace billing information.
