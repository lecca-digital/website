<Step>
    ### Create a Pull Request

    After ensuring your commits and branch names follow the conventional commit and branch name guidelines, open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch. Provide a clear and concise title and description for your PR, including:

    The purpose of your changes
    Any related issue numbers
    Specific areas youâ€™d like feedback on (if applicable)

</Step>

<Step>
    ### Automatic Checks

    Once you create a PR, our CI/CD pipeline will automatically run tests and linting checks. Ensure all tests pass and there are no linting errors. If any issues arise, address them promptly and push updates to your branch.

<Step>
    ### Review & Merge

    A reviewer will be notified and make sure the code meets coding standards, proper use of directory structures, adequate test coverage, and see if there are any potential improvements or optimizations that can be made.

    Once everything looks good, the PR will be merged to main.

    ### Release to Production

    We don't have a strict release schedule. We'll try to do it as often as makes sense. Maybe every day or every week depending on what's been added.
