title: Server Directories
---

The [server](/apps/server) runs on a Node.js framework, [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), and is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It is structured using modules, controllers, and services. Modules contain controllers and services. Controllers contain the api endpoints or routes that the client uses to interact with the server. Controllers do not contain any logic besides validation logic. Then they call a service to handle the request. Services interface with the database and perform the actual logic requested by the user.

The server directories you will most likely be working with are the following

- [/apps/server/src/apps/public](/apps/server/src/apps/public) - App integrations are found here. Each integration has its own folder containing an `actions` folder, `triggers` folder, and `connections` folder. The root of the folder contains the app file `<IntegrationName>.app.ts`. Each action within the actions folder follows the format `<IntegrationName>.action.ts`. And each trigger (if any) within the triggers folder follows the format `<IntegrationName>.trigger.ts`. Make sure to add the actions and triggers to the app file.

- [/apps/server/src/apps/public/workflow-apps](/apps/server/src/apps/public/workflow-apps.ts) - An object containing every app available on the platform. When you create a new integration, make sure you add it here so it can be available in the server as well as the client.

- [/apps/server/src/config/server.config.ts](/apps/server/src/config/server.config.ts) - We do not directly use `process.env` anywhere in the server besides this file. We always define a property within the `ServerConfig` object and use that instead. So if you need to add a new integration that requires a `CLIENT_SECRET` and a `CLIENT_ID`, make sure to define it within this file in the `INTEGRATIONS` property.

- [/apps/server/src/modules/ai-provider/ai-provider.service.ts](/apps/server/src/modules/ai-provider/ai-provider.service.ts) - We manually add new ai providers. If they match the openai specification we can use `createOpenAI` to create a provider instance. The reason we have to manually add them is because we have to calculate the cost in the [ai-provider-defaults.ts](/apps/server/src/modules/ai-provider/ai-provider-defaults.ts) file. But since we're open sourcing and a lot of people won't be using credits anyways when they run locally, we may be able to figure out a way to determine which providers support credits, which require api keys, and which ones are running locally or have a custom baseUrl.

- [/apps/server/prisma/schema.prisma](/apps/server/prisma/schema.prisma) - Defines the database schema using Prisma. Run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` to migrate your database with any changes you've made in the prisma schema. You can read more about prisma at [prisma.io](https://www.prisma.io/)
