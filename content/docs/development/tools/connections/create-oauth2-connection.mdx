title: Create OAuth2 Connection
---

<Callout>We are working on a CLI to make this easier</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create connections folder

Locate the app your want to add a connection for in the apps directory `/apps/server/apps/public/your-new-app`. Add a new folder if it doesnt exist already. Title it `connections`.

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" />
    <Folder name="server" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
            <Folder name="your-new-app" defaultOpen>
              <Folder name="connections" defaultOpen />
              <File name="your-new-app.app.ts" />
            </Folder>
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create connection file

Create a new file within your app's connection folder. For an oauth2 connection, call it `your-new-app.oauth2.ts`, replacing `your-new-app` with your app id (which should match your app file).

Add your own values. We provided mock data to help initialize the process.

```ts
import { OAuth2Connection } from "@/apps/lib/connection";
import { InputConfig } from "@/apps/lib/input-config";
import { ServerConfig } from "@/config/server.config";

import { YourNewApp } from "../your-new-app.app";

export class YourNewAppOAuth2 extends OAuth2Connection {
  app: YourNewApp;
  id = "your-new-app_connection_oauth2";
  name = "OAuth2";
  description = "Connect using OAuth2";
  inputConfig: InputConfig[] = [];
  authorizeUrl = "";
  tokenUrl = "";
  clientId = ServerConfig.INTEGRATIONS.YOUR_NEW_APP_CLIENT_ID;
  clientSecret = ServerConfig.INTEGRATIONS.YOUR_NEW_APP_CLIENT_SECRET;
  scopes = [];
}
```

1. Name the class: Make sure the class starts with your app class name and ends with `<AppName>OAuth2`
2. Add the type to the app property, E.g. `app: YourNewApp`.

   <Callout>
     Not necessary unless you're going to use the methods defined on the App
     class within your connection class.
   </Callout>

3. Add an id: `your-new-app_connection_oauth2`

   - Make sure the id follows the format `<app-id>_connection_oauth2`

4. Add the authorize url.

   This is a url that will be sent to the client to redirect the user to start the auth flow. For example, `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`

5. Add the tokenUrl.

   This is used by the server to retrieve access tokens, refresh tokens, and to refresh the tokens. For example, `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`

6. Add the client id and client secret.

   You will need to create an account on the third party platform and follow their instructions to generate these values.

   Once you have the values, you will need to add them as environment variables and then add the environment variable names to the `ServerConfig.INTEGRATIONS` object found in `server.config.ts`

   <Callout>
     The environment variable must start with `INTEGRATION`. For example,
     `INTEGRATION_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`. The value must be added to to `INTEGRATION`
     property in the ServerConfig object. If you view the `server.config.ts`
     file, you will find all the other integration properties understand how to
     format it.
   </Callout>

7. Add the required scopes to perform the api calls needed for actions and triggers.

{" "}

<Callout type="warn">
  If you ever need to update these scopes, all connections created with the old
  scopes will still work, but not have the new scopes. We currently don't have a
  way to refresh old connections with new scopes. So try to make sure you have
  all scopes you need and think will be needed in the near future.

For example, don't just get the `read` scope, get the `write` scope as well. Because even if you only plan on adding a read action, it is very likely someone will want to add the write action in the future.

This being said, don't add all the scopes. This is usually a good discussion you can start so that multiple people can determine what scopes are most likely to be needed for the app.

You can always create multiple oauth2 connections with different levels of access. Though we don't really have a good UX for that and could lead to confusing.

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Add new connection to the app's connections property

```ts
export class YourNewApp extends App {
  ...

  connections(): Connection[] {
    return [new YourNewAppOauth2({ app: this })]; // [!code highlight]
  }

  ...
}
```
