title: Create Basic Auth Connection
---

Use a basic auth connection when needing to authenticate with a third party app using a username and password

<Callout>We are working on a CLI to make this easier</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create connections folder

Locate the your app folder in the [apps directory](https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io/tree/main/packages/apps/src/lib/your-new-app) and add a new `connections` folder if it doesn't exist already.

<Files>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" />
    <Folder name="server" />
    <Folder name="toolkit" />
    <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="lib" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="your-new-app" defaultOpen>
            <Folder name="actions" />
            <Folder name="connections" defaultOpen>
              <File name="your-new-app.basic-auth.ts" />
            </Folder>
            <Folder name="triggers" />
            <File name="your-new-app.app.ts" />
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create connection file

Create a new file within your app's connection folder. For a basic auth connection, call it `your-new-app.basic-auth.ts`, replacing `your-new-app` with your app id (which should match your app file).

Add your own values. We provided mock data to help initialize the process.

```ts
import { createBasicAuthConnection } from "@lecca-io/toolkit";

export const yourNewAppBasicAuth = createBasicAuthConnection({
  id: "your-new-app_connection_basic-auth",
  name: "Basic Auth",
  description: "Connect using a username and password",
});
```

1. Name the class: Make sure the class starts with your app class name and ends with `<appName>BasicAuth`
2. Add an id: `your-new-app_connection_basic-auth`

   - Make sure the id follows the format `<app-id>_connection_basic-auth`

3. You don't need to modify the name or description.

</Step>

<Step>
### Add new connection to the app's connections property

```ts title="your-new-app.app.ts"
import { createApp } from "@lecca-io/toolkit";

export const yourNewApp = createApp({
  ...
  actions: [],
  triggers: [],
  connections: [yourNewAppBasicAuth], // [!code highlight]
});
```

</Step>
