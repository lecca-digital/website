title: Toolkit
---

The Toolkit is a package that provides functions to easily create apps, actions, and triggers.

<Callout>We are working on a CLI to make this easier</Callout>

If you're building your own package to be imported as an app in your self hosted version of the platform, you can install it via npm
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lecca-io/toolkit, otherwise, the toolkit package is available within the lecca-io monorepo.

These functions just provide types and simplify the process to creating a tool. They will just return a javascript object. If you wish to define the objects without the use of the functions you can do so, but it is not recommended.
