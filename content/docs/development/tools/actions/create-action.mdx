title: Create Action

<Callout>We are working on a CLI to make this easier</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create actions folder

Locate the your app folder in the [apps directory](https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io/tree/main/packages/apps/src/lib/your-new-app) and add a new `actions` folder if it doesn't exist already.

<Files>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" />
    <Folder name="server" />
    <Folder name="toolkit" />
    <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="lib" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="your-new-app" defaultOpen>
            <Folder name="actions" defaultOpen>
              <File name="new-action.action.ts" />
            </Folder>
            <Folder name="connections" />
            <Folder name="triggers" />
            <File name="your-new-app.app.ts" />
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

<Step>
### Create action file

Create a new file within your app's action folder. Make sure it ends with `.action.ts`.

Add your own values. We provided mock data to help initialize the process.

```ts
import { createAction, createTextInputField } from "@lecca-io/toolkit";
import { z } from "zod";

export const newAction = createAction({
  id: "your-new-app_action_new-action",
  name: "",
  description: "",
  aiSchema: z.object({}),
  inputConfig: [],
  run: async ({ configValue, connection }) => {},
  mockRun: async () => {},
});
```

1. `export const newAction = createAction`

   - Replace newAction with the name of your action.

2. Add an id: `your-new-app_action_new-action`

   - Make sure the id follows the format `<app-id>_action_<action-name-in-kebab-case>`

3. Add a name for your action
4. Add a brief one sentence description
5. Add an AI Schema

   This is a [zod schema](https://zod.dev/) used for AI to "fill out" the form to configure this action.

   <Callout>

   Read more about the [AI Schema](/docs/development/tools/configs/ai-schema).

   </Callout>

6. Add an Input Config

   This is used to generate the form for the UI to configure this action.

   <Callout>
     Read more about the [Input
     Config](/docs/development/tools/configs/input-config)
   </Callout>

7. Define the `run` function.

   This is the function that runs during workflow steps or when an AI agent uses this action as a tool. Whatever is returned from this function can be used in subsequent steps in the workflow or by an AI agent.

   The common arguments used by this function are `configValue` and `connection`.

   1. `configValue` represents the Input Config or AI Schema that was used when the user or AI agent configuring this action.
   2. `connection` is the decrypted connection properties of the connection selected by the user when configuring this action. May contain an api key, accessToken, username & pass, or key pairs.

      <Callout>
        If using an oauth2 connection, do not worry about handling refresh
        tokens, that is handled by the engine. Just make the api call assuming
        the access token is valid.
      </Callout>

8. Define the `mock` function.

   The `mock` function is used by users when they want to generate a mock output instead of making an real api call to their third party integration.

   <Callout>
     Ouput data is used to map to other nodes in the workflow builder. This is
     done by clicking `Save & Test` in the configuration form.
   </Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Add new action to the app's actions property

```ts title="your-new-app.app.ts"
import { createApp } from "@lecca-io/toolkit";

export const yourNewApp = createApp({
  ...
  actions: [newAction], // [!code highlight]
  triggers: [],
  connections: [],
});
```
