title: Create Action
---

<Callout>We are working on a CLI to make this easier</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create actions folder

Locate the app your want to add an action for in the apps directory `/apps/server/apps/public/your-new-app`. Add a new folder if it doesnt exist already. Title it `actions`.

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" />
    <Folder name="server" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
            <Folder name="your-new-app" defaultOpen>
              <Folder name="actions" defaultOpen />
              <File name="your-new-app.app.ts" />
            </Folder>
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create action file

Create a new file within your app's action folder. Call it something like `new-action.action.ts`. Make sure it ends with `.action.ts`.

Add your own values. We provided mock data to help initialize the process.

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

import {
  Action,
  ActionConstructorArgs,
  RunActionArgs,
} from "@/apps/lib/action";
import { InputConfig } from "@/apps/lib/input-config";
import { NodeViewOptions } from "@/apps/lib/trigger";
import { ServerConfig } from "@/config/server.config";

export class NewAction extends Action {
  app: YourNewApp;
  id = "your-new-app_action_new-action";
  name = "";
  description = "";
  aiSchema = z.object({
    //Use zod to create a schema
  });
  inputConfig: InputConfig[] = [
    //Add a configuration to display the form
  ];

  async run({
    configValue,
    connection,
  }: RunActionArgs<ConfigValue>): Promise<Response> {
    //Define the run function and return the output you want returned from the tool.
    //configValue is the values that were passed via the form or the ai schema.
  }

  async mockRun({
    configValue,
  }: RunActionArgs<ConfigValue>): Promise<Response> {
    //Return a value that represents the shape of the object that would be
    //returned when someone runs this action.
    //This is used when someone doesn't want to run this action with real data
    //but need data to map the data to other steps in a workflow.
  }
}

type ConfigValue = z.infer<Search["aiSchema"]>;

type Response = {
  //Define your response type
};
```

1. Name the class: export class `YourNewApp`
2. Add an id: `your-new-app_action_new-action`

   - Make sure the id follows the format `<app-id>_action_<action-id>`

3. Add a name: `New Action`
4. Add a description: `Does something cool`
5. Add an AI Schema

   This is a [zod schema](https://zod.dev/) used for AI to "fill out" the form to configure this action.

   <Callout>

   Read more about the [AI Schema](/docs/development/tools/configs/ai-schema).

   </Callout>

6. Add an Input Config

   This is used to generate the form for the UI to configure this action.

   <Callout>
     Read more about the [Input
     Config](/docs/development/tools/configs/input-config)
   </Callout>

7. Define the `run` function.

   This is the function that runs during workflow steps or when an AI agent uses this action as a tool. Whatever is returned from this function can be used in subsequent steps in the workflow or by an AI agent.

   The common arguments used by this function are `configValue` and `connection`.

   1. `configValue` represents the Input Config or AI Schema that was used when the user or AI agent configuring this action.
   2. `connection` is the decrypted connection properties of the connection selected by the user when configuring this action.

8. Define the `mock` function.

   The `mock` function is used by users when they want to generate a mock output instead of making an real api call to their third party integration.

   <Callout>
     Ouput data is used to map to other nodes in the workflow builder. This is
     done by clicking `Save & Test` in the configuration form.
   </Callout>

### Add new action to the app's actions property

```ts
export class YourNewApp extends App {
  ...

  actions(): Action[] {
    return [new NewAction({ app: this })]; // [!code highlight]
  }

  ...
}
```

</Step>
