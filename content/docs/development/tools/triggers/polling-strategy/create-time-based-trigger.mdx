title: Create Time Based Trigger
---

<Callout>We are working on a CLI to make this easier</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create triggers folder

Locate the your app folder in the [apps directory](https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io/tree/main/packages/apps/src/lib/your-new-app) and add a new `triggers` folder if it doesn't exist already.

<Files>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" />
    <Folder name="server" />
    <Folder name="toolkit" />
    <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="lib" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="your-new-app" defaultOpen>
            <Folder name="actions" />
            <Folder name="connections" />
            <Folder name="triggers" defaultOpen>
              <File name="new-trigger.trigger.ts" />
            </Folder>
            <File name="your-new-app.app.ts" />
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create trigger file

Create a new file within your app's trigger folder. Call it something like `new-trigger.trigger.ts`. Make sure it ends with `.trigger.ts`.

Add your own values. We provided mock data to help initialize the process.

```ts
import {
  createTimeBasedPollTrigger,
  isValidMilliOrNull,
} from "@lecca-io/toolkit";

export const newTrigger = createTimeBasedPollTrigger({
  id: "your-new-app_trigger_new-trigger",
  name: "",
  description: "",
  inputConfig: [
    //Add a configuration to display the form
  ],
  run: async ({ configValue, connection }) => {
    //This must return an array of items with a timestamp.
    //Must have the most recent items.
    return [];
  },
  mockRun: async () => {
    return [
      //Must return an array
    ];
  },
  extractTimestampFromResponse({ response }) {
    //Each element in the array response must have some sort of date.
    //This method should extract and return the millisecond time.
    //If the response does not have a timestamp of some sort, then you cannot use
    //the time based poller trigger
    //use a util like dateStringToMilliOrNull or isValidMilliOrNull to handle this.

    return response.timestamp; //change to the millisecond timestamp
  },
});
```

1.  `export const newTrigger = createTrigger`

    - replace newTrigger with the name of your trigger.

2.  Add an id: `your-new-app_trigger_new-trigger`

    - Make sure the id follows the format `<app-id>_trigger_<trigger-name-in-kebab-case>`

3.  Add a name for your trigger
4.  Add a brief one sentence description

5.  Add an Input Config

    This is used to generate the form for the UI to configure this trigger.

    <Callout>
      Read more about the [Input
      Config](/docs/development/tools/configs/input-config)
    </Callout>

6.  Define the `run` method.

    This method will run every time the trigger polls.

    The common arguments used by this method are `configValue` and `connection`.

    1.  `configValue` represents the Input Config that was used when the user configured this trigger.
    2.  `connection` is the decrypted connection properties of the connection selected by the user when configuring this trigger.

        <Callout>
          If using an oauth2 connection, do not worry about handling refresh
          tokens, that is handled by the engine. Just make the api call assuming
          the access token is valid.
        </Callout>

    Return an array of the most recent items with a timestamp.

    <Callout>
      It is very important that you return an array of recent items with
      timestamps. The engine saves the latest timestamp, and every time it
      polls, if there is a later timestamp, it updates. All items in the
      returned array that are larger than the previously saved timestamp, will
      trigger an execution.
    </Callout>

7.  Define the `mock` method.

    The `mock` method is used by users when they want to generate a mock output instead of making an real api call to their third party integration.

    <Callout>
      Ouput data is used to map to other nodes in the workflow builder. This is
      done by clicking `Save & Test` in the configuration form.
    </Callout>

8.  Define the `extractTimestampFromResponse` method

    Each result returned from the `run` method must have some sort of timestamp that can be transformed into a millisecond timestamp.

</Step>

### Add new trigger to the app's triggers property

```ts title="your-new-app.app.ts"
import { createApp } from "@lecca-io/toolkit";

export const yourNewApp = createApp({
  ...
  actions: [],
  triggers: [newTrigger], // [!code highlight]
  connections: [],
});
```

</Step>
