title: Create Time Based Trigger
---

<Callout>We are working on a CLI to make this easier</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create triggers folder

Locate the app your want to add a trigger for in the apps directory `/apps/server/apps/public/your-new-app`. Add a new folder if it doesnt exist already. Title it `triggers`.

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" />
    <Folder name="server" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
            <Folder name="your-new-app" defaultOpen>
              <Folder name="triggers" defaultOpen />
              <File name="your-new-app.app.ts" />
            </Folder>
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create trigger file

Create a new file within your app's trigger folder. Call it something like `new-trigger.trigger.ts`. Make sure it ends with `.trigger.ts`.

Add your own values. We provided mock data to help initialize the process.

```ts
import { InputConfig } from "@/apps/lib/input-config";
import { RunTriggerArgs, TimeBasedPollTrigger } from "@/apps/lib/trigger";
import { isValidMilli } from "@/apps/utils/is-valid-milli";

import { YourNewApp } from "../your-new-app.app";

export class NewTrigger extends TimeBasedPollTrigger {
  app: YourNewApp;
  id = "your-new-app_trigger_new-trigger";
  name = "";
  description = "";
  inputConfig: InputConfig[] = [
    //Add a configuration to display the form
  ];

  async run({
    configValue,
    connection,
  }: RunTriggerArgs<ConfigValue>): Promise<Response[]> {
    //This must return an array
  }

  async mockRun(): Promise<Response[]> {
    return [
      //Must return an array
    ];
  }

  extractTimestampFromResponse({ response }: { response: Response }) {
    //Each element in the array response must have some sort of date.
    //This method should extract and return the millisecond time.
    //If the response does not have a timestamp of some sort, then you cannot use
    //the time based poller trigger
    //use a util like dateStringToMilliOrNull or isValidMilliOrNull to handle this.

    return response.timestamp; //change to the millisecond timestamp
  }
}

type Response = {
  //Define the response item.
};

type ConfigValue = {
  //Define your config value types from the inputConfig
};
```

1. Name the class: export class `NewTrigger`
2. Add an id: `your-new-app_trigger_new-trigger`

   - Make sure the id follows the format `<app-id>_trigger_<trigger-id>`

3. Add a name
4. Add a description

5. Add an Input Config

   This is used to generate the form for the UI to configure this trigger.

   <Callout>
     Read more about the [Input
     Config](/docs/development/tools/configs/input-config)
   </Callout>

6. Define the `run` method.

   This method will run every time the trigger polls.

   The common arguments used by this method are `configValue` and `connection`.

   1. `configValue` represents the Input Config that was used when the user configured this trigger.
   2. `connection` is the decrypted connection properties of the connection selected by the user when configuring this trigger.

   Return an array of the most recent items with a timestamp.

   <Callout>
     It is very important that you return an array of recent items with
     timestamps. The engine saves the latest timestamp, and every time it polls,
     if there is a later timestamp, it updates. All items in the returned array
     that are larger than the previously saved timestamp, will trigger an
     execution.
   </Callout>

7. Define the `mock` method.

   The `mock` method is used by users when they want to generate a mock output instead of making an real api call to their third party integration.

   <Callout>
     Ouput data is used to map to other nodes in the workflow builder. This is
     done by clicking `Save & Test` in the configuration form.
   </Callout>

8. Define the `extractTimestampFromResponse` method

   Each result returned from the `run` method must have some sort of timestamp that can be transformed into a millisecond timestamp.

</Step>

### Add new trigger to the app's triggers property

```ts
export class YourNewApp extends App {
  ...

  triggers(): Trigger[] {
    return [new NewTrigger({ app: this })]; // [!code highlight]
  }

  ...
}
```

</Step>
