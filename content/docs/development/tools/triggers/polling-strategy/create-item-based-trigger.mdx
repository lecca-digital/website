title: Create Item Based Trigger
---

<Callout>We are working on a CLI to make this easier</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  Only use this trigger type if you cannot use the Time Based trigger.
  Timestamps are a more reliable way of determining new data, but if all you
  have is a unique identifier, then this trigger should work fine. Just make
  sure that the data you retrieve can be returned in a consistent order every
  time.
</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create triggers folder

Locate the app your want to add a trigger for in the apps directory `/apps/server/apps/public/your-new-app`. Add a new folder if it doesnt exist already. Title it `triggers`.

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" />
    <Folder name="server" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
            <Folder name="your-new-app" defaultOpen>
              <Folder name="triggers" defaultOpen />
              <File name="your-new-app.app.ts" />
            </Folder>
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create trigger file

Create a new file within your app's trigger folder. Call it something like `new-trigger.trigger.ts`. Make sure it ends with `.trigger.ts`.

Add your own values. We provided mock data to help initialize the process.

```ts
import { InputConfig } from "@/apps/lib/input-config";
import { RunTriggerArgs, ItemBasedPollTrigger } from "@/apps/lib/trigger";
import { isValidMilli } from "@/apps/utils/is-valid-milli";

import { YourNewApp } from "../your-new-app.app";

export class NewTrigger extends ItemBasedPollTrigger {
  app: YourNewApp;
  id = "your-new-app_trigger_new-trigger";
  name = "";
  description = "";
  inputConfig: InputConfig[] = [
    //Add a configuration to display the form
  ];

  async run({
    configValue,
    connection,
  }: RunTriggerArgs<ConfigValue>): Promise<Response[]> {
    //This must return an array in descending order. Newest items first.
  }

  async mockRun(): Promise<Response[]> {
    return [
      //Must return an array descending order. Newest items first
    ];
  }

  extractItemIdentifierFromResponse({
    response,
  }: {
    response: Response;
  }): string {
    //Each element in the array response must have some sort of unique identifier.
    //This method should extract that identifier.
    //If the response does not have a unique id, then you cannot use the item based trigger
    return args.response.some - identifier;
  }
}

type Response = {
  //Define the response item.
};

type ConfigValue = {
  //Define your config value types from the inputConfig
};
```

1.  Name the class: export class `NewTrigger`
2.  Add an id: `your-new-app_trigger_new-trigger`

    - Make sure the id follows the format `<app-id>_trigger_<trigger-id>`

3.  Add a name
4.  Add a description

5.  Add an Input Config

    This is used to generate the form for the UI to configure this action.

    <Callout>
      Read more about the [Input
      Config](/docs/development/tools/configs/input-config)
    </Callout>

6.  Define the `run` method.

    This method will run every time the trigger polls.

    The common arguments used by this method are `configValue` and `connection`.

    1. `configValue` represents the Input Config that was used when the user configured this trigger.
    2. `connection` is the decrypted connection properties of the connection selected by the user when configuring this trigger.

    Return an array of items in descending order. The newest items first.

        <Callout>

    It is very important that you return an array of items with the newest
    items first in the array. The engine saves the newest item's id, and every
    time it polls, it finds the index of that id in the newly polled data.
    If that id doesn't exist in the new data, all the items are ran because they are considered new.
    If the id does exist, then it grabs all the items that are earlier in the array from the matching index.
    The id (acting as a pointer), is then updated to the newest id.

        </Callout>

7.  Define the `mock` method.

    The `mock` method is used by users when they want to generate a mock output instead of making an real api call to their third party integration.

    <Callout>
      Ouput data is used to map to other nodes in the workflow builder. This is
      done by clicking `Save & Test` in the configuration form.
    </Callout>

8.  Define the `extractItemIdentifierFromResponse` method.

    Each result returned from the `run` method must have some sort of unique identifier that this method can extract and return.

</Step>

### Add new trigger to the app's triggers property

```ts
export class YourNewApp extends App {
  ...

  triggers(): Trigger[] {
    return [new NewTrigger({ app: this })]; // [!code highlight]
  }

  ...
}
```

</Step>
