title: Enable Tools
---

Lecca.io and the community provide tools that you can easily use. However, there are some that require certain environment variables to be setup in order for them to be visible in the UI and run on the server without errors.

<Callout>
  To get a deep dive into all available environment variables refer to
  [`server.config.ts`](https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io/blob/main/apps/server/src/config/server.config.ts).
