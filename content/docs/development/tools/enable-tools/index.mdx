title: Enable Tools
---

Lecca.io and the community provide tools that you can easily use. However, there are some that require certain environment variables to be setup in order for them to be visible in the UI and run on the server without errors.

<Callout>
  To get a deep dive into all available environment variables refer to
  [`server.config.ts`](https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io/blob/main/packages/server/src/config/server.config.ts).

  <Card
    title="Phone Calling"
    href="/docs/development/tools/enable-tools/ai-actions"
  >

So unless the tool you need is one of these custom apps, pre-built AI actions, or an app that integrates to a third party platform using OAuth2, you should immediately have access to it without any additional configuration.
