## Enabling Pre-built AI Actions

Lecca.io provides prebuilt AI Actions that users can use in their workflows and provide as tools for their AI Agents.

In order for the UI to see these actions, there must be at least 1 AI Provider Api Key found in the Environment Varibles.

Make sure at least one of these exists:

1. `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. `GEMINI_API_KEY`
3. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

Any new providers that are added should also be added to this list
