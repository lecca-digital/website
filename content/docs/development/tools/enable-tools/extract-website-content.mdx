Lecca.io provides a way to easily allow users to extract content from websites in their workflows or allow their agents to do.

These actions uses apify to search the web. A few things need to be done for this feature to be enabled.

    ### APIFY_API_KEY

    ### APIFY_EXTRACT_DYNAMIC_CONTENT_TASK_ID

    This key is used for extracting dynamic content from websites (javascript enabled).

    1. Create a task from the apify/website-content-crawler actor.
    2. Modify the crawler settings to whatever limit of pages you want (I set mine to 1).
    3. Use the task ID for the environment variable, APIFY_EXTRACT_DYNAMIC_CONTENT_TASK_ID

</Step>

    ###  APIFY_EXTRACT_STATIC_CONTENT_TASK_ID

    This key is used for extracting content from static websites.

    1. Create a task from the apify/cherio-scraper actor.
    2. Modify the crawler settings to whatever limit of pages you want (I set mine to 1).
    3. Use the task ID for the environment variable, APIFY_EXTRACT_STATIC_CONTENT_TASK_ID

    ### Add all Api Keys to environment varibles

    Once they are added as environment variables, the `ServerConfig` will pull them in automatically.
