## Enabling Tools that require OAuth2 Connections

App's that require this type of connection will need 2 environment variables to be setup for each app.

1. Client ID
2. Client Secret

If you look at the any of the `<integration>.oauth2.ts` files in the [apps](https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io/tree/main/packages/apps/src/lib) directory, you will see the required process.env CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET required for that app's integration.
If the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` values are not set in the environment variables, then the app will not be visible in the UI.
