Every action requires an `inputConfig` and an `aiSchema` so that the action can be configured by both a human and an AI agent.

Triggers on the other hand cannot be configured by an AI agent, therefore they do not need an `aiSchema`, only an `inputConfig`.

<Callout>
  You can think of `Input Config` as the human schema, and `AI Schema` as the AI
  agent schema. Both must overlap and are values passed to the `run` method of
  any action or trigger.
