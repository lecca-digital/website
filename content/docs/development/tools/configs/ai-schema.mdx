title: AI Schema
---

The AI Schema is the schema that is given the an AI Agent to fill out the necessary fields to run an action as a tool.

The schema is created using [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

Here are a couple suggestions when creating a schema.

1. Make sure each property has a description if the property key is not descriptive by iteself. This will help the AI know what the property is..
2. Make sure if a property is not required, to add `.nullable().optional()` to the field.

Here is a _requirement_ when creating a schema.

- Make sure the AI Schema matches the Input Config as much as possible.

  The AI Schema types are inferred and used to type the `configValue` argument in the run and mockRun functions of an action and trigger.

  There are cases where the `inputConfig` is complex, using a lot of `loadOptions`, and dynamic values. In this case, the UI sometimes has extra fields to dynamically load a critical field for the action. You may omit those extra fields in the `aiSchema` since they're not used in the `run` function.
  But you will have to create your own type for the Input Config when defining the run function.
