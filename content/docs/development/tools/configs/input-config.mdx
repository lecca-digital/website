title: Input Config
---

The Input Config is the schema that defines the form seen in the UI when configuring an action or trigger.

The input config is comprised of input fields of different types. Some are text, select, numbers, json, and even nested fields.

<Callout>
  The `@lecca-io/toolkit` package in the monorepo (and available in npm)
  provides typed functions to help you create input fields easily.

All these are exported from the package.

```
export * from './createDateInputField';
export * from './createDateRangeInputField';
export * from './createDateTimeInputField';
export * from './createDynamicMultiSelectInputField';
export * from './createDynamicSelectInputField';
export * from './createFileInputField';
export * from './createJsonInputField';
export * from './createMapInputField';
export * from './createMultiSelectInputField';
export * from './createNestedFields';
export * from './createNumberInputField';
export * from './createSelectInputField';
export * from './createSwitchInputField';
export * from './createTextInputField';
export * from './createMarkdownField';
```

You can use them like

```ts
inputConfig: [
  createTextInputField({
    id: "name",
    label: "Name", // [!code highlight]
    description: "Name of recipient",
  }),
];
```

Then you don't have to guess what properties are required for what input type.

</Callout>

Let's go over the properties, then we'll go into depth on the input types and the properties required for certain input types.

## Properties on Field Config

- ### `id`

  This is the id of the value that will be passed into the `configValue` argument of the `run` function of your action or trigger.

  For example, if you have a text field with id `name`. The config value would look something like this:

  ```ts

  inputConfig: [
    createTextInputField({
      id: 'name',
      label: 'Name', // [!code highlight]
      description: 'Name of recipient',
    }),
  ],
  run: async ({ configValue }) {
    const { name } = configValue // [!code highlight]
    ...
  }

  ```

- ### `description`

  Adds a tooltip to the field. If you don't want a tooltip, just leave as an empty string.

- ### `placeholder`

  Adds a placeholder in the text box or select dropdown.

- ### `occurenceType`

  Default is `single`. If you change this to `multiple`, then the field will become an array and the user can add multiple entries of the field.

- ### `required`

  If left empty, the field is not required. If it is required, set the value to type:

  ```ts
  {
    missingMessage: string;
    missingStatus: "warning" | "error"; //Always use "warning"
  }
  ```

  Always use `warning` for better UX. Or else the node will be red as soon as a user starts configuring it (because the field isn't filled out yet).

- ### `loadOptions`

  These are options to modify the appearance of the field.

  - `dependsOn`

  Can be an array of either `strings` or `{ id: string, value: string | string[] }`

  If `dependsOn` is set, then this field will not be visible until all items of the `dependsOn` array are met.

  Strings in the array are ids of other fields. So if you have the string `name` in the `dependsOn` array, then this field won't be visible until the `name` field has a value.

  Objects in the array are ids and values of other fields. So if you have the object `{ id: 'name', value: 'Bob'}`, then this field won't be visible until the the `name` field has a value of `Bob`.

  <Callout type="warn">
    There is some behavior we hope to fix eventually where if a field has a
    value, but then disapears due to the `dependsOn` array not being met, the
    value still exists and is passed to the `run` method of the action or
    trigger. Because of this, you must add run time validation to prevent this
    misuse of config properties you don't expect to have values.
  </Callout>

  - `executionOnly`

  Makes the field only visible when in the execution view, not the workflow builder.

  - `workflowOnly`

  Makes the field only visible when in the workflow builder, not the execution view.

  - `forceRefresh`

  Will cause a force re-fetch if any of the dependsOn field changes. You can still click the `refresh` button.

  - `hideRefreshButton`

  Hides the refresh button. Pairs well with force refresh.

## Input Types

- ### `text`

  Field where a user can add text

- ### `file`

  Field where a user can add a url to a file

  <Callout>
    Roadmap Item: allow user to upload file directly instead of having to
    reference a url
  </Callout>

- ### `select`

  Provides the user with a list of options to select one from.

  Required property: `selectOptions`

  ```ts
  type SelectOptions = {
    label: string;
    value: string;
  }[];
  ```

- ### `multi-select`

  Similar to `select`

  Provides the user with a list of options, however they can choose more than one.

- ### `dynamic-select`

  Similar to `select`, however the select options are fetched and returned to the user at runtime.

  Required property: `_getDynamicValue`

        The arguments passed to `_getDynamicValue` include the `projectId`, `agentId`, `workflowId`, `extraOptions` and/or the `connection`. Use these arguments to make an api call to return dynamic data.

        <Callout>
        `extraOptions` are values passed when using the `loadOptions.dependsOn`
        property in your field config.

        For example, if you make a `field B` depend on `field A`, then the `extraOptions` will contain the value of `field A`. This allows you to use the dependencies in retrieving dynamic data.
        </Callout>

- ### `dynamic-multi-select`

  Similar to `dynamic-select`, however the more than one option can be selected.

  Required property: `_getDynamicValue`

- ### `date`

  Field that allows the user to select a date. The date time defaults to midnight of the user's timezone.

- ### `date-time`

  Field that allows the user to select a date and time. The timezone will be the user's timezone

- ### `date-range`

  Field that allows the user to select a date range.

- ### `switch`

  Displays a toggle that the user can switch between.

  Required property: `switchOptions`

  ```ts
  export type SwitchOptions = {
    checked: string;
    unchecked: string;
    defaultChecked: boolean;
  };
  ```

- ### `number`

  Displays a number input field.

  Optional property: `numberOptions`

  ```ts
  export type NumberOptions = {
    max?: number;
    min?: number;
    step?: number;
  };
  ```

- ### `map`

Displays a key - value table

Required property: `occurenceType: 'dynamic'`

      <Callout type="warn">

            Don't use this one unless you know what you're doing.

            Might deprecate this or refactor how it works. Currently only used with `occurenceType: 'dynamic'` which is a hacky way to dynamically generate an input config with dynamic values.

      </Callout>

- ### `json`

Displays a text input field, however there is some descriptive text saying it will be parsed as json.

Eventually, I would like this field to automatically be parsed as json, but at the moment, we have to use the util function, `jsonParse`, to parse this value at runtime within the `run` method.

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure you parse it or else the "json" users think they are passing will
  just be treated as a string.
</Callout>

- ### `markdown`

Displays markdown instead of an input. This is helpful when needing to provide extra information inside the configuration form.

Required property: `markdown`

<Callout>
  You will still need to add an id, description, and label to the input field.
  What is done at the moment is something like `id: 'markdown'`, `description:
  ''`, `label: ''`
</Callout>

## Nested Fields

Nested fields are used with `occurenceType: 'multiple'` to allow the UI to to display a group of fields that can be added multiple times.

It is defined by creating an Input Field with an `inputConfig` field within it.

```ts
export type NestedInputConfig = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  description: string;
  occurenceType: OccurenceType;
  inputConfig: FieldConfig[];
};
```
