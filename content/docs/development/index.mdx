This is the documentation for developers looking to add their own apps to Lecca.io. It covers how to setup your development environment, add integrations, create actions, create triggers, and add new AI providers.

All these additions can be used with your workflows and agents. And if you are willing, you can make a PR to the [lecca-io](https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io) repo so everyone can benefit.
