title: Database
---

Before starting the server, you'll need a running database. This can be done using Docker:

1. Install Docker for your OS if you don't have it.
2. Run the following command (customize values as needed):
   `docker run --name docker-container-name -d
-e POSTGRES_DB=mydb
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123
-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres
-p "5432:5432" postgres
`
3. Run the following command to migrate your database to match the prisma schema.
   `pnpm prisma migrate dev`
