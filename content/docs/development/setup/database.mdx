title: Database
---

Before starting the server, you'll need a running database. This can be done using Docker:

1. Install Docker for your OS if you don't have it.
2. Run the following command (customize values as needed):

   ```docker
   docker run --name docker-container-name -d -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -p "5432:5432" postgres
   ```

   <Callout>
     Make sure to `docker-container-name` to whatever name you want your
     container to be. Also make sure these database values match your .env
     database values
   </Callout>

3. Run the following command to migrate your database to match the prisma schema. `pnpm prisma migrate dev`
