title: Environment Variables
---

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the root directory
2. Create a new `.env` file and copy the contents from `.env.example`

   You can manually configure the .env file when getting started, or you can run one of the scripts provided for you in the `./scripts` directory

   <Callout>
     If you're on `Mac` or `Linux` run the `./scripts/setup-env.sh` script to
     generate the `.env` file for you. You will need to run `chmod +x
     ./scripts/setup-env.sh` to make the script executable.
   </Callout>

   <Callout>
     If you're on `Windows` run the `./scripts/setup-env.ps1` script to generate
     the `.env` file for you.
   </Callout>

   <Callout type="warn">
     This script will override any existing `.env` file you already have. So
     this is mainly used when you are setting things up for the first time.
   </Callout>

3. Add additional env variables to enable platform features.

   The scripts and the .env.example file only provide the env variables required to get the platform running. To enable all the features you'll need to add more configurations.

   <Callout>
     For full functionality, refer to
     [`server.config.ts`](https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io/blob/main/packages/server/src/config/server.config.ts)
     for all possible environment variables and their use cases.
