title: Installation
---

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Clone the repo https://github.com/lecca-digital/lecca-io
- navigate to the repo `cd lecca-io`

## Initial Setup

1. Setup environment variables

   Run the `setup-env.sh` or `setup-env.ps1` scripts in the `./scripts` directory to generate a `.env` file for you or you can manually generate your `.env` file using the `.env.example` file as a reference.

   <Callout>
     If on Mac or Linux Make the script executable. ```chmod +x
     ./scripts/setup-env.sh``` then run the script `./script/setup-env.sh`
   </Callout>

   <Callout>If on Windows run the script `./scripts/setup-env.ps1`</Callout>

   <Callout type="warn">
     This script will override any existing `.env` file you already have. So
     this is mainly used when you are setting up things for the first time.
   </Callout>

2. Start the application:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This command will:

   - Create necessary networks and volumes
   - Pull all required Docker images
   - Start all services (PostgreSQL, Server, and UI)

   You should now be able to navigate to your CLIENT_URL and use the platform.

## Managing Your Application

### Checking Services Status

Check if all services are running:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### Viewing Logs

View logs for all services:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

View logs for specific services:

```bash
# UI logs
docker compose logs ui

# Server logs
docker compose logs server

# Database logs
docker compose logs postgres

# Follow logs in real-time (add -f flag)
docker compose logs -f server
```

### Stopping and Starting Services

Stop all services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Start all services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Complete Cleanup

To remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Using the -v flag will remove all volumes and delete your database data. Only
  use this if you want to completely reset your installation.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Services won't start

   ```bash
   # Check for port conflicts
   docker compose ps
   # Check detailed logs
   docker compose logs
   ```

   Common causes:

   - Port conflicts (5173, 9094, or 5432 already in use)
   - Environment variables not set correctly
   - Insufficient permissions

2. Database connection issues

   ```bash
   # Check database health
   docker compose ps postgres
   # Check database logs
   docker compose logs postgres
   ```

   Common causes:

   - Incorrect database credentials in .env
   - Database initialization failed
   - Volume permissions issues

3. Server can't connect to database
   ```bash
   # Check server logs
   docker compose logs server
   ```
   Common causes:
   - `DATABASE_URL` not properly configured
   - Database not ready when server starts
   - Network issues between containers
